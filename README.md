# autoBAHN

The goal of this project is to provide a simple JAVA program to evaluate and graphically display the data of several sensors for object detection and distance measurement (ultrasonic, infrared, laser etc.).

The first version includes an interface to use sensors via National Instruments data acquisition hardware (e.g. NI USB 6008) and the NIDAQmx Base driver software. It was tested with NI USB 6008 and an ultrasonic sensor from Waycon.
